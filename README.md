# FGPA_DPU_object_detector
A image identifier implemented with FGPA to achieve fast real-time multiple object detection.

# Project Goals:
1. Find a state-of-art multiple object detection model
2. Measure  its performance on GPU for inferencing
3. Deploy the model on FPGA  DPU 
4. Measure the inferencing performance
5. Compare performances
* Make roofline plot
* Calculate memory bandwidths for the DL program on GPU and FPGA


# User Stories:
* Navigation for Robots
* Surveillance
* Self-Driving cars

Use YOLOv3 algorithm
